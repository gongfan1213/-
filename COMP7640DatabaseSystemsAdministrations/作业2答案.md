## Exercise 1: Disk File Transfer Time Calculation

### Problem Statement

A disk has the following characteristics:
- **Average seek time:** 20 ms  
- **Track-to-track seek time:** 4 ms  
- **Rotational delay:** 4 ms  
- **Maximum transfer rate:** 20 ms per track  
- **Bytes per sector:** 256 bytes  
- **Sectors per track:** 50  
- **Tracks per cylinder:** 10  
- **Tracks per surface:** 1,000  

A file contains 500 records (each record is 256 bytes). Determine:

1. The total time (in seconds) to transfer all records into main memory when using a **“random” strategy**.  
2. The total time (in seconds) to transfer all records into main memory when using the **“next” strategy**.

---

### (1) Random Strategy

**Analysis:**  
In the random strategy, every record is accessed independently. For each record, the following operations occur:
1. **Seek:** The disk head moves to the required track, costing the average seek time of 20 ms.
2. **Rotational Delay:** The disk must wait for the desired sector to rotate under the head (4 ms).
3. **Transfer:** A record is read from one sector. Since one track takes 20 ms to transfer 50 sectors, the transfer time per sector is  
   \[
   \frac{20\,\text{ms}}{50} = 0.4\,\text{ms}.
   \]

**Per Record Time Calculation:**  
\[
\text{Time per record} = 20\,\text{ms (seek)} + 4\,\text{ms (rotational delay)} + 0.4\,\text{ms (transfer)} = 24.4\,\text{ms}.
\]

**Total Time for 500 Records:**  
\[
500 \times 24.4\,\text{ms} = 12,200\,\text{ms} = 12.2\,\text{seconds}.
\]

---

### (2) Next Strategy

**Analysis:**  
The “next” strategy takes advantage of sequential storage. Since records are stored consecutively, the disk can read a whole track at once, thereby reducing seek operations. 

1. **Records per Track:**  
   Each track contains 50 sectors, and since each record occupies one sector, one track holds 50 records.  
   \[
   \text{Number of tracks needed} = \frac{500}{50} = 10 \text{ tracks}.
   \]

2. **Timing for the First Track:**  
   - **Rotational delay:** 4 ms  
   - **Transfer:** 20 ms for the entire track  
   Total = 4 ms + 20 ms = **24 ms**

3. **Timing for Each Subsequent Track:**  
   For tracks 2 through 10, the disk performs:
   - **Track-to-track seek:** 4 ms  
   - **Rotational delay:** 4 ms  
   - **Transfer:** 20 ms  
   Total per subsequent track = 4 + 4 + 20 = **28 ms**  
   For the remaining 9 tracks:
   \[
   9 \times 28\,\text{ms} = 252\,\text{ms}.
   \]

**Total Time Calculation:**  
\[
24\,\text{ms} + 252\,\text{ms} = 276\,\text{ms} = 0.276\,\text{seconds}.
\]

## Exercise 2: I/O Cost Estimation with ISAM Index vs. Binary Search

### Problem Statement

A relation **R** contains 1,000,000 records, each 64 bytes in size. Each disk block (page) can hold 4,000 bytes. An ISAM index is built on **R** where each index entry (both in leaf and nonleaf pages) takes 4 bytes. Estimate:

1. The search I/O cost using the ISAM index.
2. The I/O cost of using binary search on **R**.

---

### Step 1: Compute Basic Values

**Number of Records per Data Block:**  
\[
\frac{4000\,\text{bytes}}{64\,\text{bytes/record}} \approx 62 \text{ records/block}.
\]

**Total Number of Data Blocks in R:**  
\[
\text{Number of blocks} = \lceil \frac{1\,000\,000}{62} \rceil \approx 16\,130 \text{ blocks}.
\]

---

### (1) I/O Cost Using the ISAM Index

**ISAM Index Structure:**
- **Leaf Level:**  
  Each index entry is 4 bytes, so a block can hold:  
  \[
  \frac{4000}{4} = 1000 \text{ entries}.
  \]
  To cover 1,000,000 records, the number of leaf pages required is:  
  \[
  \lceil \frac{1\,000\,000}{1000} \rceil = 1000 \text{ pages}.
  \]

- **Nonleaf Level:**  
  Each nonleaf block can also hold 1000 entries (or pointers). Thus, the next level (the root) needs:  
  \[
  \lceil \frac{1000}{1000} \rceil = 1 \text{ block}.
  \]

**I/O Operations for a Search:**
- Read the **root (nonleaf) page:** 1 I/O  
- Read the corresponding **leaf page:** 1 I/O  
- Read the actual **data block** (that contains the record): 1 I/O

Thus, the total search I/O cost using the ISAM index is:
\[
1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \text{ I/Os}.
\]

---

### (2) I/O Cost Using Binary Search

When performing a binary search directly on the relation, we assume that the file is stored in sorted order on disk.

- **Total Data Blocks:** ≈ 16,130 blocks  
- **Binary Search I/O Cost:**  
  The number of block accesses required is approximately  
  \[
  \lceil \log_2 (16\,130) \rceil \approx 14 \text{ I/Os}.
  \]
- **Record Retrieval:**  
  After identifying the block, one additional I/O is needed to read the block containing the target record.

Thus, the total I/O cost using binary search is:
\[
14 + 1 = 15 \text{ I/Os}.
\]

## Exercise 3: B+ Tree Index Operations

### Problem Statement

A B+ tree index is given (each leaf entry is a \<key, record-id\> pair, and all keys are integers). Based on the diagram in Figure 1 (assume the following original structure):

```
              [15 | 37]
             /      |      \
Leaf 1: [8, 12, 14]   Leaf 2: [15, 17, 20, 22]   Leaf 3: [37, 40, 45, 50]
```

Answer the following:

1. For a query with condition **12 < key < 23**, how many I/Os in total (including reading the records) are needed when using this B+ tree index?
2. Draw the B+ tree after inserting **4*** and **6*** into the original B+ tree.
3. Draw the B+ tree after deleting **37*** from the original B+ tree.

*Note:* In the drawings below, an asterisk (*) indicates the key being inserted or deleted.

---

### (1) I/O Cost for Query: 12 < key < 23

**Analysis:**

- **Index Traversal:**  
  - **Root Access:** One I/O to read the root node.
  - **Leaf Access:**  
    The query range spans keys in two leaf nodes. Based on our assumed structure:
    - **Leaf 1:** Contains [8, 12, 14]. Only the key 14 satisfies (12 < key).  
    - **Leaf 2:** Contains [15, 17, 20, 22], all of which satisfy the condition.
    
    Thus, two leaf nodes must be accessed (2 I/Os).

- **Data Record Access:**  
  Assume that each qualifying record is stored in a separate data block. There are a total of 5 records (1 from Leaf 1 and 4 from Leaf 2). This would add 5 I/Os.

**Total I/O Cost:**  
\[
1 \text{ (root)} + 2 \text{ (leaves)} + 5 \text{ (data blocks)} = 8 \text{ I/Os}.
\]

*Assumption:* This analysis assumes that each record is stored in a separate disk block (i.e., worst-case scenario for non-clustered storage).

### (2) B+ Tree after Inserting 4* and 6*

**Insertion Process:**

- **Step 1:**  
  Both keys 4 and 6 are less than 15, so they belong in **Leaf 1**.  
  Original Leaf 1: [8, 12, 14]  
  After inserting 4 and 6 in sorted order: [4, 6, 8, 12, 14].

- **Step 2 (Node Split):**  
  Assume the maximum number of keys allowed in a leaf is 4. With 5 keys, Leaf 1 overflows.  
  Standard B+ tree splitting for a leaf node with 5 keys:  
  - Split into two nodes: one with ⎡5/2⎤ = 3 keys and the other with the remaining 2 keys.
  - **New Left Leaf (L1):** [4, 6, 8]  
  - **New Right Leaf (L1′):** [12, 14]  
  The first key of the new right node (12) is then promoted as a separator to the parent node.

- **Step 3 (Parent Update):**  
  The original parent node was: [15 | 37].  
  After inserting the new separator:
  - The parent now becomes: [12 | 15 | 37]  
  - The updated child pointers are:  
    - Pointer 1 → Leaf: [4, 6, 8]  
    - Pointer 2 → Leaf: [12, 14]  
    - Pointer 3 → Leaf: [15, 17, 20, 22]  
    - Pointer 4 → Leaf: [37, 40, 45, 50]

**Final B+ Tree After Insertions:**

```
                  [12 | 15 | 37]
                 /      |       |      \
   Leaf 1: [4, 6, 8]  Leaf 1′: [12, 14]  Leaf 2: [15, 17, 20, 22]  Leaf 3: [37, 40, 45, 50]
```

---

### (3) B+ Tree after Deleting 37*

**Deletion Process:**

- **Step 1:**  
  Start with the original B+ tree:
  ```
                [15 | 37]
               /      |      \
   Leaf 1: [8, 12, 14]   Leaf 2: [15, 17, 20, 22]   Leaf 3: [37, 40, 45, 50]
  ```
  The key 37 is located in **Leaf 3**.

- **Step 2:**  
  Remove 37 from Leaf 3. The updated Leaf 3 becomes:  
  \[
  [40, 45, 50]
  \]

- **Step 3 (Parent Update):**  
  The separator key 37 in the parent (which originally was [15 | 37]) must be updated because it no longer correctly represents the lower bound of Leaf 3.  
  The new first key in Leaf 3 is now 40. Hence, the parent node is updated to:  
  \[
  [15 | 40]
  \]

**Final B+ Tree After Deletion:**

```
                [15 | 40]
               /      |      \
   Leaf 1: [8, 12, 14]   Leaf 2: [15, 17, 20, 22]   Leaf 3: [40, 45, 50]
```
