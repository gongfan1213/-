### **Exercise 1: Disk Transfer Time Calculation**

#### **Given Data:**
- **Average Seek Time** = 20 ms
- **Track-to-Track Seek Time** = 4 ms
- **Rotational Delay** = 4 ms
- **Max Transfer Rate** = 20 ms per track
- **Bytes per Sector** = 256 bytes
- **Sectors per Track** = 50
- **Tracks per Cylinder** = 10
- **Tracks per Surface** = 1000
- **File Size** = 500 records
- **Record Size** = 256 bytes

Each record occupies exactly one sector since the sector size matches the record size. Thus, we need to read 500 sectors.

#### **(1) Random Strategy Calculation**
In the random strategy, each record is accessed independently, leading to a seek time, a rotational delay, and a data transfer time for each record. The total time per record is:

\[ \text{Total Time per Record} = \text{Seek Time} + \text{Rotational Delay} + \text{Transfer Time} \]

- Seek Time = 20 ms
- Rotational Delay = 4 ms
- Transfer Time per sector = (20 ms per track) / (50 sectors per track) = 0.4 ms

Thus, the total time per record is:
\[ 20 + 4 + 0.4 = 24.4 \text{ ms} \]

Total time for 500 records:
\[ 500 \times 24.4 = 12,200 \text{ ms} = 12.2 \text{ s} \]

#### **(2) Next Strategy Calculation**
In the next strategy, we read consecutive records in the same track before moving to the next track. This significantly reduces seek time.

Each track holds:
\[ 50 \text{ sectors (or records)} \]

Number of tracks needed:
\[ 500 / 50 = 10 \text{ tracks} \]

Time taken per track:
\[ \text{Rotational Delay} + \text{Transfer Time per Track} \]
\[ 4 + 20 = 24 \text{ ms} \]

Total time for 10 tracks:
\[ 10 \times 24 = 240 \text{ ms} = 0.24 \text{ s} \]

Adding one seek per track:
\[ 9 \times 4 = 36 \text{ ms} \]

Total time:
\[ 0.24 + 0.036 = 0.276 \text{ s} \]

### **Exercise 2: ISAM vs. Binary Search I/O Cost**

#### **Given Data:**
- **Records in Relation R** = 1,000,000
- **Record Size** = 64 bytes
- **Block Size** = 4000 bytes
- **Index Entry Size** = 4 bytes

#### **(1) ISAM Index Search I/O Cost**

Number of records per block:
\[ 4000 / 64 = 62.5 \approx 62 \]

Total number of blocks:
\[ 1,000,000 / 62 = 16,129 \]

Assuming a fan-out (number of entries per node) of:
\[ 4000 / 4 = 1000 \]

Number of levels:
\[ \log_{1000} 16129 \approx 2.2 \Rightarrow 3 \text{ levels} \]

Total I/O cost = Number of levels + 1 (to fetch the record):
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ I/Os} \]

#### **(2) Binary Search I/O Cost**

Binary search on blocks requires:
\[ \log_2 16129 \approx 14 \]

Total I/O cost:
\[ 14 + 1 = 15 \text{ I/Os} \]

### **Exercise 3: B+ Tree Operations**

#### **(1) I/O Cost for Query 12 < key < 23**

- The query searches for a range of keys.
- It follows the B+ tree path to the first relevant leaf node.
- It then scans sequentially until key > 23.
- If each leaf holds 4 keys, we assume 3 nodes involved.
- Total I/O: **3 (traversal) + 3 (sequential read) = 6**.

#### **(2) B+ Tree After Inserting 4* and 6***

- Insert 4*: It goes into the appropriate leaf without splitting.
- Insert 6*: If the leaf is full, it will split, propagating changes upwards.
- The final tree structure should reflect proper balancing.

#### **(3) B+ Tree After Deleting 37***

- Locate 37* and remove it.
- If underflow occurs, merge or redistribute nodes.
- Update parent nodes if necessary.
